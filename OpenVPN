Majority following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4i_kkx50lw

First download OpenVPN Connect (https://openvpn.net/client/)
Also make sure you are not double natted - my isp was, so I had to get them to remove their private ip

=============================
In pve create Container with 'ubuntu-20.04-standard_20.04-1_amd64.tar.gz' template
   - Using all defaults
Make sure machine does not startup once finished

On pve console:
	cd /etc/pve/lxc
	nano xxx.conf     (whatever box the created template above is)

In this file we need to add the following 2 lines:
	lxc.cgroup.devices.allow: c 10:200 rwm
	lxc.mount.entry: /dev/net dev/net none bind,create=dir

Save the file
	chown 100000:100000 /dev/net/tun
This command will reconfigure the owner of the file to allow and unplugged which contain access after it begins running

To make sure this worked use this command
	ls -l /dev/net/tun
It should look something like:
	crw-rw-rw- 1 100000 100000 10, 200 Sep 24 19:00 /dev/net/tun

=============================
Now startup the container we made at the beginning

	apt update && apt upgrade -y
	apt install openvpn git
	git clone https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install
	cd openvpn-install
	bash openvpn-install.sh

I needed to double check my WAN IP found in my router settings (for some reason this was not working previously)
The rest should be the same

Back in the root folder open the newly created .ovpn configuration file.
Copy all the contents of that file and paste it on a folder in your desktop.

=============================
Open your router settings - navigate to Port Forwarding / Virtual Server
Create a new port forward to the created IP and port we made in the bash command

The .ovpn file that was created in the container - paste all the contents in a folder on our designated computer
Import that .ovpn file into our OpenVPN Connect application and it should connect!

If it does not, it was not configured correctly. Switch to a phone hotspot to test!
